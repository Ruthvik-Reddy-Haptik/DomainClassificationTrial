# DomainClassificationTrial
Multi class domain classification using various techniques.
# From ScikitLearn: 
Multi Nomial Naive-Bayes, SVM, LogisticRegression.
# LSTM 
### Note:
Data rescaling has to be done as we have highly unbalanced classes.
Recall can be increased by classifying top two probabilities in the predictions as true.
